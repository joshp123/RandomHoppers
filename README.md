Random Hoppers: PHYS2320 Assigment 1
=====================================

Language: C# (its the best thing ever really)
----------------------------------------------

Actual source code located in RandomHoppers\Hoppers.cs

TODO: document all these terrible functions properly using XML (this probably will never happen becuase it's legit effort)

TODO: make the UI interactive so you can use it from the command line and enjoy waiting for ages while it calculates a bajillion iterations

TODO: make this readme look not terrible (lmao if u think i'll actually do this)

Licensing or whatever:
-------------------------
Copy whatever the hell you like as long as you say something along the lines of "that idiot joshp123 guy wrote this terrible code, blame him if it breaks". (except you're on your own if you steal my code and it breaks). Also if you're stupid enough to steal this and then charge someone even stupider for it, then gimme a kickback yo.

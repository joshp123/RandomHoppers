Actual source code located in RandomHoppers\Hoppers.cs

Copy whatever the hell you like as long as you say something along the lines of "that idiot joshp123 guy wrote this terrible code, blame him if it breaks". (except you're on your own if you steal my code and it breaks). Also if you're stupid enough to steal this and then charge someone even stupider money for it, then gimme a kickback yo.
